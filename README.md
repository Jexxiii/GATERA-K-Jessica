1. Problem Definition

Business Context:
A retail company operating in Rwanda wants to analyze its sales performance across regions and product categories. The marketing department needs better insights to drive promotions and customer segmentation.

Data Challenge:
Although transactions are recorded, managers lack advanced analytics for ranking products, understanding sales trends, and grouping customers by spending.

Expected Outcome:
Identify top-selling products by region and quarter, track sales growth, and segment customers into meaningful quartiles for marketing campaigns.

2. Success Criteria (Goals)

Top 5 products per region/quarter â†’ RANK()

Running monthly sales totals â†’ SUM() OVER()

Month-over-month growth % â†’ LAG()/LEAD()

Customer quartiles (segments) â†’ NTILE(4)

3-month moving averages â†’ AVG() OVER()

3. Database Schema

Tables:

customers: customer_id (PK), name, region

products: product_id (PK), name, category

transactions: transaction_id (PK), customer_id (FK), product_id (FK), sale_date, amount

4. Window Functions Implementation
(a) Ranking â€“ Top Products per Region
SELECT 
    c.region,
    p.name AS product,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_sales,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.region ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC) AS rank_in_region
FROM transactions t
JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.region, p.name;


ðŸ“Š Insight: Shows which products dominate sales in each region.

(b) Aggregate â€“ Running Monthly Totals
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(t.sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    SUM(t.amount) AS monthly_sales,
    SUM(SUM(t.amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(t.sale_date, '%Y-%m')) AS running_total
FROM transactions t
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(t.sale_date, '%Y-%m');


ðŸ“Š Insight: Helps track how revenue accumulates over time.

(c) Navigation â€“ Month-over-Month Growth
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT 
      DATE_FORMAT(t.sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
      SUM(t.amount) AS total_sales
  FROM transactions t
  GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(t.sale_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    month,
    total_sales,
    LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS prev_month_sales,
    ROUND(((total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / 
           LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month)) * 100, 2) AS growth_percent
FROM monthly_sales;


ðŸ“Š Insight: Identifies whether sales are growing or declining month-to-month.

(d) Distribution â€“ Customer Quartiles
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_spent,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC) AS spending_quartile
FROM transactions t
JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name;


ðŸ“Š Insight: Customers are grouped into 4 segments â€” top spenders (Q1) down to least active (Q4).

(e) Moving Average â€“ 3-Month Trend
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT 
      DATE_FORMAT(t.sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
      SUM(t.amount) AS total_sales
  FROM transactions t
  GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(t.sale_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    month,
    total_sales,
    ROUND(AVG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS three_month_avg
FROM monthly_sales;


ðŸ“Š Insight: Smooths fluctuations and shows long-term sales trends.

5. Results Analysis

Descriptive:
Sales are dominated by electronics in Kigali, with beverages more common in Huye. Revenue is steadily increasing month-to-month.

Diagnostic:
Growth spikes are linked to laptop purchases. Seasonal beverage sales occur around Januaryâ€“March.

Prescriptive:
Focus promotions on top quartile customers, expand electronics marketing in Kigali, and offer discounts in lower quartile segments to encourage spending.
